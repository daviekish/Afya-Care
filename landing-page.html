            <h3><u>Antibiotics</u></h3>
            <ol>
              <p> Antibiotics are powerful medicines that fight certain infections and can save lives when used
                properly. They either stop
                bacteria from reproducing or destroy them.

                Before bacteria can multiply and cause symptoms, the immune system can typically kill them. White blood
                cells (WBCs)
                attack harmful bacteria and, even if symptoms do occur, the immune system can usually cope and fight off
                the infection.

                Sometimes, however, the number of harmful bacteria is excessive, and the immune system cannot fight them
                all.
                Antibiotics are useful in this scenario.</p>

              <h4><em>Antibiotics commonly cause the following side effects:</em></h4>

              <li>nausea</li>
              <li>vomiting</li>
              <li>rash</li>
              <li>upset stomach</li>
              <li>with certain antibiotics or prolonged use, fungal infections of the mouth, digestive tract, and vagina
              </li>
              <li>Less common side effects of antibiotics include:

                formation of kidney stones, when taking sulphonamides
                abnormal blood clotting, when taking some cephalosporins)
                sensitivity to sunlight, when taking tetracyclines
                blood disorders, when taking trimethoprim
                deafness, when taking erythromycin and the aminoglycosides
                Some people, especially older adults, may experience bowel inflammation, which can lead to severe,
                bloody diarrhea.

                In less common instances, penicillins, cephalosporins, and erythromycin can also cause inflamed bowels.

            <h3><u>Painkillers</u></h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Pain can be mild, moderate or severe. It can be treated using different strengths of painkiller,
                depending on your level
                of pain. Your doctors and nurses will assess your pain and prescribe the best painkillers to help
                control it.</li>

              <li>Mild pain is often treated with non-opioid drugs, for example paracetamol and anti-inflammatory drugs
                (Brufen速,
                Neurofen速).</li>
              <li>Moderate to severe pain is usually treated with painkillers called opioids. These include
                dihydrocodeine (DF118 Forte速,
                DHC Continus速), codeine phosphate, tramadol, morphine, fentanyl and oxycodone.
                Sometimes opioids are used to treat mild pain.</li>

              <li>Non-opioids can be used in combination with opioids. Other medicines, known as adjuvant drugs, may
                also be used to
                control pain. Examples are bisphosphonates and steroids.</li>

              <li> painkillers give quick relief that lasts for a short time. These are called short-acting painkillers.
                Long-acting
                painkillers (also called slow-release painkillers) are slower to control the pain but are effective for
                a longer time.</li>

              <li> painkillers can cause <em>side effects</em> in some people. If you have any side effects, tell your
                doctor or nurse.</li>

            <ul>

              A depressant, or central depressant, is a drug that lowers neurotransmission levels, which is to depress
              or reduce arousal or stimulation, in various areas of the brain.[1] Depressants are also occasionally
              referred to as "downers" as they lower the level of arousal when taken. Stimulants or "uppers" increase
              mental and/or physical function, hence the opposite drug class of depressants is stimulants, not
              antidepressants.

              Depressants are widely used throughout the world as prescription medicines and as illicit substances.
              Alcohol is a very prominent depressant. Alcohol can be and is more likely to be a large problem among
              teenagers and young adults. When depressants are used, effects often include ataxia, anxiolysis, pain
              relief, sedation or somnolence, and cognitive/memory impairment, as well as in some instances euphoria,
              dissociation, muscle relaxation, lowered blood pressure or heart rate, respiratory depression, and
              anticonvulsant effects, and even complete anesthesia or death at high doses. Cannabis may sometimes be
              considered a depressant. THC may slow brain function to a small degree, while reducing reaction to
              stimuli. Cannabis may also treat insomnia, anxiety and muscle spasms similar to other depressive drugs.
              Other depressants can include drugs like xanax and a number of opiates.

              Depressants exert their effects through a number of different pharmacological mechanisms, the most
              prominent of which include facilitation of GABA, and inhibition of glutamatergic or monoaminergic
              activity. Other examples are chemicals that modify the electrical signaling inside the body. The most
              prominent of these being bromides and channel blockers.

            <p> The 4 major drug classes currently used to treat malaria include quinoline-related compounds,
              antifolates,
              artemisinin derivatives, and antimicrobials. No single drug that can eradicate all forms of the parasite's
              life cycle has been discovered or manufactured yet. Therefore, 1 or more classes of drugs often are given
              at
              the same time to combat malarial infection synergistically. Treatment regimens are dependent on the
              geographic location of infection, the likely Plasmodium species, and the severity of disease presentation.

              Beware of counterfeit antimalarial drugs being taken by patients that may have been purchased overseas or
              via the Internet. They may not contain any active ingredients at all and may contain dangerous materials.

              Antipyretics, such as acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are indicated to
              reduce the level of discomfort caused by the infection and to reduce fever. NSAIDs should be used with
              caution if bleeding disorder or hemolysis is suspected.

              Antimalarials can cause significant prolongation of the QT interval, which can be associated with an
              increased risk of potentially lethal ventricular dysrhythmias. Patients receiving these drugs should be
              assessed for QT prolongation at baseline and carefully monitored if this is present. Patients with normal
              QT
              intervals on electrocardiogram (ECG) may not be at a significantly increased risk for drug-induced
              dysrhythmia, but caution is advised, particularly if the patient is taking multiple drug regimens or if he
              or she is on other drugs affecting the QT interval.

              Methemoglobinemia is a complication that may be associated with high-dose regimens of quinine or the
              derivatives chloroquine and primaquine. [24] A patient presenting with cyanosis and a normal PaO2 on room
              air should be suspected of having methemoglobinemia.</p>

          <h3 class="sex"><u>Contraceptives</u></h3>
          <ul>
            Hormonal contraceptives (the pill, the patch, and the vaginal ring) all contain a small amount of man-made
            estrogen and progestin hormones. These hormones work to inhibit the body's natural cyclical hormones to
            prevent pregnancy. Pregnancy is prevented by a combination of factors. The hormonal contraceptive usually
            stops the body from ovulating. Hormonal contraceptives also change the cervical mucus to make it difficult
            for the sperm to go through the cervix and find an egg. Hormonal contraceptives can also prevent pregnancy
            by changing the lining of the womb so it's unlikely the fertilized egg will be implanted.

            Another option for hormonal contraceptives is the extended-cycle pill, such as Seasonale, which was the
            first one to be approved. Seasonale contains the same hormones as other birth control pills, but the
            hormones are taken in a longer cycle. That reduces the number of menstrual periods from 13 periods a year to
            only four a year. That means a woman who takes this pill will menstruate only once each season.

            Seasonale contains the same combination of two hormones that are commonly used in other hormonal
            contraceptives. But the pill is taken continuously for 12 weeks followed by one week of inactive pills,
            which results in a menstrual cycle. Other extended-cycle pills, such as Seasonique and LoSeasonique use a
            different configuration of the same hormones. Both of these pills use estrogen in the final week, with
            LoSeasonique providing a lower dose option.

            The flu attacks the lungs, nose and throat. Young children, older adults, pregnant women and people with
            chronic disease or weak immune systems are at high risk.
            Symptoms include fever, chills, muscle aches, cough, congestion, runny nose, headaches and fatigue.
            The flu is treated primarily with rest and fluid to let the body fight the infection on its own.
            Over-the-counter anti-inflammatory pain relievers may help with symptoms. An annual vaccine can help prevent
            the flu and limit its complications.

     For example, I am to take my
  medication at 1.00 pm the the programme will know the time and remind me 5 minutes earlier that is 12.55 pm.
   Isn't that great ?

  And wouldn't it even be better if it reminds you your appointment with your doctor ?
   Yep it will remind you to your doctor's appointment
  a day before.

    <p>Afya care is a website that is programmed to help users on medication to take their medicine on time.
      For example, I am to take my
      medication at 1.00 pm the the programme will know the time and remind me 5 minutes earlier that is 12.55 pm.
      Isn't that great ?

      And wouldn't it even be better if it reminds you your appointment with your doctor ?
      Yep it will remind you to your doctor's appointment
      a day before.

      Our website will show you the kind of reactions one will have when a certain medication it takes, the allergies or the side effects</p>
